# TinyProjects

Machine Learning:

Neural net -- A neural net I wrote for a homework assignmnet.

Bayes net -- A tree augmented bayes net I wrote for a homework assignment.

(For both of these projects I had to write a lot of tools from scratch, because of submission requirements. In practice I would prefer to use networkX and other python packages, since they would make the code cleaner to read and more efficient.)

Probability:

Brownian Motion Simulator -- A tool I wrote to experiment with brownian motion.

Beroulli -- A tool to play with and visualize bernoulli shifts / dyadic transformation.

Exercises:

Merge Lists -- A exercise from leetcode.com. Merges K sorted lists into one sorted list.
