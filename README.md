Machine Learning:

Perceptron with Animation -- Exactly what it sounds like; an animation of a perceptron training on linearly classified data

Majority Voting -- Experimenting with majority vote classifiers. This experiment makes a good argument for democracy, because it shows that a lot of poorly informed but rational learning machines can collectively make a good decision by majority voting, even if individually they don't make good decisions.

Class Projects...

Neural net -- A neural net I wrote for a homework assignmnet.

Bayes net -- A tree augmented bayes net I wrote for a homework assignment.

(For both of these projects I had to write a lot of tools from scratch, because of submission requirements. In practice I would prefer to use networkX and other python packages, since they would make the code cleaner to read and more efficient.)



Probability:

Brownian Motion Simulator -- A tool I wrote to experiment with brownian motion.

Beroulli -- A tool to play with and visualize bernoulli shifts / dyadic transformation.

Markov Sample Subset -- Samples a subset of a set by random walk.

Exercises:

Merge Lists -- A exercise from leetcode.com. Merges K sorted lists into one sorted list.
